# ehealth-app

To create a web app with the following requirements:

1. A Sign up page for users

2. A page where users can fill in their medical information 
with relevant questions depending on the developer's discretion to be stored in a Database, SQLite would do just fine.

3. A page that displays the statistical details of the medical records gotten from the users(all users can view this page).
e.g A chart that shows the count for users with Ebola.

4. A table that displays all users and their relevant medical records, this page should be available to an admin user only.
